<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Shivam Saraswat, an aspiring Computer Science student passionate about technology, coding, and creative problem-solving. I'm currently building strong foundations in Web Development, C++ DSA, and Graphic Design.

I enjoy learning new tools, building projects, and continuously pushing my limits. My goals include contributing to open source (GSoC), participating in ICPC, and eventually working with top tech companies or building my own startup.

This portfolio showcases my learning journey, projects, and skills as I grow into a tech professional.

Letâ€™s connect and create something amazing!</p>
